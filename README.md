# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Coffee Companion assistant

Tap the floating robot bubble above the tab bar to launch the hover chat surface. It talks to the Nest backend's `/assistant/message` endpoint. To use it locally:

1. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` so the Expo app can reach your backend.
2. Ensure the backend has `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optionally `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_MODEL`, `COFFEE_APP_SUPPORT_EMAIL`) configured.
3. Grant location access in the Expo client so weather-aware recommendations can be generated.

Conversations stay on-device per user session, and the assistant automatically inherits your JWT token, so no additional setup is required in the client.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
